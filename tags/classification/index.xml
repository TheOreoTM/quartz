Movement An action by an organism or part of an organism causing a change of position Respiration The chemical reaction in cells that breakdown nutrient molecules and release energy for metabolism Sensitivity The ability to detect or sense stimuli in the internal or external environment and to make appropriate responses Growth A permanent increasing in size and dry mass by an increase in cell number or cell size or both Reproduction It is the process that make more of the same kind of organism Excretion Removal from organism of the waste products of metabolism (chemical reactions in cells including respiration) toxic materials and substances in excess of requirements Nutrition Taking in of materials for energy, growth and development.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://theoreotm.github.io/quartz/Biology/010-Topics/Classification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theoreotm.github.io/quartz/Biology/010-Topics/Classification/</guid><description>Classification Classification means putting things into groups.
