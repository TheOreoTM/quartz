### How to calculate average value
- Lets take a sample of `5` oscillations, [1.30, 1.31, 1.30, 1.33, 1.32]
- Then we add all the oscillations together [1.30 + 1.31 + 1.30 + 1.33 + 1.32] = [6.56]
- Then we take the sum and divide it by the total number of oscillation, which in our case is `5`
$$Average = \frac{6.56}{5}$$
$$Average = 1.31$$
