# Pressure (1st Method)
---
> SI Unit = N/m<sup>3</sup> *(or)* Pascal (Pa)
- Pressure can be measure by 'manometer'
- Manometer is a small U-shaped tube holding small amount of liquid

$$P = ρ \cdot g\cdot h$$
$$ρ = \frac{M}{V}$$

> Manometer
- If one side is connected to the gas supply the gas pushed down on the liquid and forces it round the bend
- If 2 sides of the manometer are open the liquid level will be equal
- [[Barometer]] is also used to measure Atmospheric Pressure

# Pressure (2nd Method)
---
> SI Unit = N/m<sup>3</sup> *(or)* Pascal (Pa)
- Pressure can also be measured as:
$$P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{(force)}{(area)}$$
# Notes
---
- If question asks for `total pressure` make sure to add `Pressure of atmosphere`
$$Patm + ρ\cdot g\cdot h$$
$$Patm = 1.01\cdot 10^3$$
