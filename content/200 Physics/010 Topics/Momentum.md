# Momentum 
> Momentum (p)= [[Mass]] x [[Velocity]]
> SI Unit = Kg m/s

- Only moving objects have momentum
- If an object is not moving it's in rest therefore its momentum will be 0

### Example
1. Find the momentum of a ball rolling with the velocity of 20Â m/s and mass of 0.5Kg
$$p = m \cdot v$$
$$p = 0.5 \cdot 20$$
$$p = 10 \space Kg\space m/s$$

### Conservation of momentum
- In any collision in which no external force acts on the total momentum before collision is equal to the total momentum after collision
  $$\text{Total momentum before collision = Total momentum after collision}$$
  $$pA = pB$$
 $$M_{1} U_{1} + M_{2} U_{2} = M_{1} V_{1} + M_{2} V_{2}$$
<sub>I'm not making an example for this, do u have any idea how long it takes to write one step. Do it yourself</sub>
