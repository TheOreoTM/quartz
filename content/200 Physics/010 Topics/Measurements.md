# Measuring length
> 
> Unit of length is 'meter (m)'
> 

### Measuring Techniques
---
1. Using measuring tape
2. Using ruler
3. Using [[Vernier Caliper]] ^c586f1
4. Using micrometer

### Measuring the length of the thread
---
1. Keep the wire near to the ruler
2. Keep the wire straight
3. End of the wire start at ZERO

### Measuring Volume
---
> SI unit = m³

*There are two types:*
- Regular (Cubes, Cuboids, etc...)
- Irregular (Stones, Other Irregularly shaped objects)

#### Regular

> Volume = l x b x h

#### Irregular

> V₁ = Measurement Before
> V₂ = Measurement After
>
> $$V_x = V_2 - V_1$$

Refer [[Procedure 001]]

### Measuring Density
---
>SI unit = kg/m³

*There are two types:*
- Regular (Cubes, Cuboids, etc...)
- Irregular (Stones, Other Irregularly shaped objects)


#### Regular
>$$D = \frac{m}{v}$$
#### Irregular
> $$D = \frac{M_2 - M_1}{V_2 - V_1}$$

Refer [[Procedure 002]]
### Measuring Time

> SI unit  = s (seconds)

**Context:**
`n` = Number of oscillations (usually 10)
`t` = Time taken for `n` oscillations
`T` = Time taken for 1 [[Oscillation]]
$$
	T = \frac{t}{n}
$$
**Example:**
$$
	T = \frac{t}{n}
$$
$$
	T = \frac{13.5}{10}
$$
$$
	T = 1.35s
$$
#### Improve Accuracy
- Measure length from center of ball
- Take time for 10 (or more) oscillations and find 1 oscillation ([[Procedure 003]])
- Repeat the readings
- Calculate average value ([[Oscillation#How to calculate average value]])
