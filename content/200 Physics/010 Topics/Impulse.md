# Impulse
> Impulse = [[Force]] x [[Measurements#Measuring Time |Time]]
> SI Unit = Ns [^1]

- A force can change motion and direction of an object. The effect of force depends on things like:
	- How big [[Force]] 'F' is
	- The [[Measurements#Measuring Time |Time]] 't' it acts for
- The bigger the [[Force]] and longer the [[Measurements#Measuring Time |Time]] it acts for, the bigger the change of motion on the object. 
- The product of [[Force]] and the [[Measurements#Measuring Time |Time]] for which the force act is sometimes referred to as [[Impulse]]

### Example
1. Calculate impulse on a car, when 120N of force act on it for 2s
$$\text{Impulse} = F \cdot t$$
$$= 120 \cdot 2$$
$$= 240\text{Ns}$$
