# Adding vectors
### Examples of vectors
---
```
 --->    OBJECT (pushing a table)
 50 N


 <---    OBJECT (moving ball)
20 m/s
```

### Add vectors
---
Adding vectors is just like adding two regular numbers

- If both vectors are going the same way, they are both (+)
$$50N + +20N = 70N$$
- But if one vector is going the opposite way then the one travelling right is (+) and the one travelling left is (-)
- Lets say there is a [[Force]] of 40N pushing right and a force of 80N pushing left
$$40N + -80N = -40N$$
> - If the answer is (-) that means the arrow should be facing left
> - If the answer is (+) that means the arrow should be facing right

### Finding resultant force using graphical method and calculations
``` 
       50N                        Scale: 10N = 1cm
------------------->|
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    | 70n
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |            
```


##### Graphical Method
- Convert it to a triangle with the right proportions 
```   
      5cm
-------------------->|
\                    |
  \                  |
    \                |
      \              |
        \            | 7cm
          \          |
            \        |
              \      |
                \    |
                  \  |
                    \|   
```
- Then you simply use a ruler to measure the hypotenuse of the triangle, here it is 8.6 cm (not to scale)
##### Calculation Method
- In this method you use the formula you use to find the hypotenuse of a triangle:
$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$
- In the example given above we can take the two sides and add it into the calculation
$$c^2 = 50^2 + 70^2$$
$$c = \sqrt{7400}$$
$$c = 86.02N = resultant force$$
