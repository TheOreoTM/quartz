# Springs
### Extension (∆X)
---
> SI Unit = m
- Increase in length of spring after it is loaded by [[Mass]]
![[Pasted image 20220523223939.png]]
- Springs will extend when its under load
$$∆X = X_2 - X_1$$
- [[Force]] is proportional to Extension

### Spring Constant (k)
---
> SI Unit = N/m

$$k = \frac{F}{X}$$
### Materials
- Elastic Materials
	- Spring regains its original shape after the removal of [[Force]]/[[Weight]]
- Plastic Materials
	- Material can not regain its original shape after the [[Force]]/[[Weight]] is removed

> Same thing but separately [[Elastic & Plastic Materials]]
