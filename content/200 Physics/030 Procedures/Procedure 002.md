# Measuring Density Of Irregular Objects
### Instruments
- Measuring cylinder
- Water
- Electronic balance
### Procedure
- Keep the measuring cylinder with water on the electronic balance
- Mark its mass (M<sub>1</sub>) and volume (V<sub>1</sub>)
- Put the object inside the measuring cylinder and measure its final mass (M<sub>2</sub>) and final volume (V<sub>2</sub>)
- Density can be found using the formulae below
$$D = \frac{M_2 - M_1}{V_2 - V_1}$$
