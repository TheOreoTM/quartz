# Classification
---
- Classification means putting things into groups.
- The main reason for classification of living things if to make it easier to study them.
- In the past, the only ways that biologists could decide which organism were most closely related to each other was to study the structure of their bodies. **They looked carefully at their morphology and their anatomy**
---
### Morphology
- The study of outward appearance of organisms
### Anatomy
- The study of their internal structure as revealed by dissection
- We have new tools to help to work out evolutionary relationships and one of the most power of these is the study of DNA. The similarities in the sequence of amino acids in protons can be used in the same way

### Origin
- The first person to classify organisms scientifically was **Linnaeus**. He divided all the different kind of living things into groups called **species** (A group of organisms that can reproduce and produce fertile off spring)

> **Species -> Genus -> Family -> Order -> Classes -> Phyla -> Kingdom**

- Linnaeus gave every species of living organisms 2 names. This is called **Binomial System**
- E.g.
| Animal | Genus | Species |
|:------:|:-----:|:-------:|
|  Fox   | Canis |  Lupus  |
