# Finding Time Taken For 1 Oscillation
### Instruments
- String
- Stand
- Bob (metal ball)
- Stop watch
### Context
`n` = Number of oscillations (usually 10)
`t` = Time taken for `n` oscillations
`T` = Time taken for 1 oscillation
$$
	T = \frac{t}{n}
$$
### Example
$$
	T = \frac{t}{n}
$$
$$
	T = \frac{13.5}{10}
$$
$$
	T = 1.35s
$$
