# Force
> SI Unit = N

- Force is a vector quantity
- It is an influence tending to change the motion of a body or produce motion or stress in a stationary body

$$F = m \cdot a$$
### Force may cause the following
- It can make an object *move* from rest
- It may *change its speed*
- It may *decrease its speed* and *stop* the motion
- It may *change the direction* of the motion of the object
### Other
- Massive objects are harder to accelerate than smaller ones
- Mass increase = Acceleration decrease
- Mass is the property that results change in its motions
